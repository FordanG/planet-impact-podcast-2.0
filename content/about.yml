    Hi, Iâ€™m Manthan Shah, and I love talking to people. I am fascinated by the
    individuals who create stuff and change the world. The people who are honest
    and vulnerable about their struggles in being a nonconformist are incredibly
    awesome. With this podcast, I extend you an invitation to join me as I
    explore stories of these people. We will celebrate their victories, but also
    their struggles and intimate moments that ultimately lead to growth and
    betterment.


    What qualifies me for such an endeavour? 20-years of curiosity, a degree in global business, two years of improv podcast training and a tremendous drive to learn from the ones who are changing the world.


    Planet Impact tries to leverage the new triple bottom line: People, Planet and Partnerships. It is an initiative to communicate the Sustainable Development Goals, and its Impact done by individuals creatively.
