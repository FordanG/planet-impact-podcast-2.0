Hi, Iâ€™m **Manthan Shah**, and *I love talking to people*. I am fascinated by the individuals who create stuff and change the world. The people who are honest and vulnerable about their struggles in being a nonconformist are incredibly awesome. With this podcast, I extend you an invitation to join me as I explore the stories of these people. We will celebrate not only their victories but also their struggles and intimate moments that ultimately lead to their growth and betterment.
