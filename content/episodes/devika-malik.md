> "One mistake that many of us make is equating disability with inability. Sometimes, we disqualify people just by assuming that they will be unable to perform a certain task."

Born a premature baby with acute neonatal jaundice and hemiplegia, Devika Malik was paralysed on one side of the body. Despite her disability, nothing could stop Devika from becoming an international para-athlete. In five years (2011-2016), she won eight national and three international medals in para-athletics.

She is trained as a Psychologist. With her mother, Padma Sri Deepa Malik, she started 'Wheeling Happiness Foundation' which is an NGO working to ensure an inclusive world & enable people with disabilities to achieve their potential. As part of their COVID response, Wheeling Happiness is supporting underprivileged families of people with disabilities with dry rations, sanitary kits & cash in hand. Today they are also providing cooked meals and free telephonic counselling.
