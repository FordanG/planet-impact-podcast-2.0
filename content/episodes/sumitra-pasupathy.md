"I am always looking for inspiring, bright and young interns"

About Sumitra: She grew up in Kaula Lampur, Malaysia. She graduated as a chemical engineer from the prestigious Cambridge University in 1995. She worked at Kraft and Proctor and Gamble before getting an MBA from INSEAD. Afterwards, she worked in the corporate world for a few years, mainly out of Singapore, before entering the impact and social entrepreneurship world upon the birth of her first son.

In 2008, she and her partner Mr Naveen Menon founded Playeum. It's an independent non-profit organisation that champions children through play and creativity. And it has won several international awards for its groundbreaking work.

In 2015, she became the country director of Ashoka: Innovators for Public for Singapore and Indonesia. Ashoka is the world's fifth-biggest NGO that is responsible for the 'social entrepreneurs' movement in the world (Bill Drayton, founder of Ashoka, literally coined the term 'Social Entrepreneurship' in 1980). Currently, she is the senior manager of Global Collaborations at Ashoka. She lives in Singapore with her husband and three- very talented tennis champ- sons.
