Felix Finkbeiner is a German environmentalist and the founder of the international tree-planting and environmental advocacy organization [Plant-for-the-Planet.](https://www1.plant-for-the-planet.org/) 

Starting in fourth grade, he attended [Munich International School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_International_School) from which he graduated in 2015. After living in London for three years, he graduated with a BA in International Relations from [SOAS, the University of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAS,_University_of_London) in 2018. Since September 2018 he is a PhD student of environmental sciences at the Crowther Lab of [ETH Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Z%C3%BCrich), where he studies the most effective approaches to forest restoration under [Prof. Tom Crowther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crowther_(ecologist)).

In January 2007, when Felix was nine years old and in fourth grade, he gave a class presentation on global warming in which he suggested to classmates that children should plant one million trees in each country of the world. Together with many of his classmates, Felix planted a tree on 28 March 2007 and launched [Plant-for-the-Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-for-the-Planet). After three years, the initiative planted its millionth tree. At age 10 he spoke in the European Parliament and at age 13 at the UN General Assembly.

The organisation currently restores 22,500 hectares of forest on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico by planting on average one tree every 15 seconds. Furthermore, [Plant-for-the-Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-for-the-Planet) leads the UN [Billion Tree Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_Tree_Campaign), as part of which 14 billion trees have been planted so far by contributing companies, organisations and governments.
