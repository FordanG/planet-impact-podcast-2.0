Federico Garcea ([@federico_garcea](https://www.instagram.com/federico_garcea/?hl=en)) is the founder and CEO of Treedom ([@treedom_trees](https://www.instagram.com/treedom_trees/?hl=en))- Financial Times Top 100 most sustainable companies in Europe, and an Ashoka Fellow from Florence, Italy. This UN World Environment Day, Federico tells us his story from being a financial analyst to being the founder of the B-Corporation which has been saving the planet one tree at a time.

Federico did a lot of odd jobs before he stumbled upon the idea of Treedom. The main source of inspiration was a combination of his travel experiences abroad and playing the famous online game FarmVille.

Founded in 2010, Treedom is the only online platform in the world where you can have someone plant a tree for you and then follow it online. Today more than 2,000,000 trees have been planted in Africa, South America and Italy. All trees are planted directly by local farmers and bring environmental, social and financial benefits to their communities. Thanks to its business model, in 2014 Treedom became part of the Certified B Corporations, a network of companies that stand out for high environmental and social performance. Every tree on Treedom is geo-localized and photographed and has its online page, it can be kept or virtually gifted to others.

By the end of this podcast, Federico shares its expansion plans in Asia. Thus giving an opportunity to collaborate and work with him.
