Gavin Thurston is the award-winning Blue Planet II and Planet Earth II cameraman who worked with Sir David Attenborough for over 20 projects. In this podcast, he shares with us the extraordinary and adventurous true stories of becoming a legendary cameraman.Â 

I met Gavin in Dubai on his book tour at Emirates Literature Festival, and instantly I was moved by his stories and his kind personality.

Gavin has been a wildlife photographer for over thirty years. Against a backdrop of modern world history, he's lurked in the shadows of some of the world's remotest places in order to capture footage of the animal kingdom's finest: prides of lions, silverback gorillas, capuchin monkeys, brown bears, grey whales, penguins, mosquitoes - you name it he's filmed it.

From journeys to the deepest depths of the Antarctic Ocean and the wide expanse of the Saharan deserts, to the peaks of the Himalayas and the wild forests of the Congo, Gavin's experiences describe much more than just the incredible array of animals he's filmed. He invites you to come inside the cameraman's hidden world and discover the hours spent patiently waiting for the protagonists to appear; the inevitable dangers in the wings and the challenges faced and overcome; and the heart-warming, life-affirming moments the cameras miss as well as capture.
