Ms Aysha grew up in Lahore, Pakistan. She completed her BA in International Relations from Mount Holyoke College in 1995 on a scholarship and graduated Magna Cum Laude. Her time at college sparked her passion for development and she chose to return to Pakistan to work in the non-profit sector. She quickly learned that girls and women in villages needed access to economic resources before they could voice their demands for social justice. After completing her MBA from LUMS in 1998, she founded the Kaarvan Foundation, a pioneering economic development not-for-profit organization focused on poverty alleviation through the provision of business development and market-led training for girls and women. She headed the Kaarvan Foundation up to 2013 when relocated to Singapore.\

Ms Aysha is currently on the Board of Kaarvan Crafts Foundation, an Ashoka Fellow and a member of Singapore Writers Group.
