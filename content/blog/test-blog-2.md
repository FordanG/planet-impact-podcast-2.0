description: This blogpost talks about my journey in US appliactions, and how I
  earned a handsome amount in scholarships and financial aid.
---
About a year ago, I decided that I wanted to pursue my undergrad in Economics from abroad. It was one of those extremely self-reflected decisions. However, US Education is synonymous with extremely expensive tuition where the cost of attendance for 4 years can quickly add up to more than 200,000 $.

I come from a progressive middle-class family. Although my parents were extremely supportive of me being the first person in our long spread family to pursue higher education from any prestigious university, I was unwilling to put my parents into this financial pressure.

With hard work and luck (the best combination for success), I was able to get admitted into 3 of the most prestigious US universities alongside a top Indian Business School with astronomical scholarships.

* I got into University of Massachusetts, Amherst, with the Chancellors award for academic excellence of 14,000$ per year scholarship towards tuition.
* I got into University of Illinois, Chicago, with a President’s Merit Scholarship for outstanding academic and extracurricular achievements of 10,000$ per year for 4 years towards tuition.
* I got into State University of New York, Binghamton, with a Provost’s Scholarship for Academic Excellence with 7,000$ per year towards tuition.
* I got into SP Jain’s Global BBA Program on scholarship. Can’t disclose the amount, I had to sign a NDA.

# How did I do it?

**I started early**– I took a gap year to explore my potential and passions. I dedicated the first half of the gap year to study for the SATs, TOEFL and SAT Level 2 Subject Tests. With sheer hard work I was able to score in the 95th percentile globally.

**Essays**– I find myself one of the very few people to have put 3 months into writing the essays. In US college applications, Essays play a major role in determining who you are as a person. There are about 2 Common Essays that go to each University; additionally, each University independently asks for 3-4 special essays. Their topics range from highly intellectual self-reflective questions to the ones that help them determine your sense of purpose in pursuing particular interests.\
I wrote at least 4 independent drafts of each essay before sending them through. And I believe they played a major role in the admission process.

**Extracurricular**– I believe I am a man of extracurricular interests. I have always pursued my passions fearlessly. With already 2 International medals and the 2 National Championship titles in my kitty, I dedicated my 12th grade and the gap year in pursuing a diverse range of passions. I got involved deeply in community service. So much so I started my own NGO known as KIN- knowledge, Integration and Networking. I taught in poor govt. schools. I headed donation camps, volunteership events, animal welfare camps, blood donation camps, cleanliness and beautification drives. Of course, this wouldn’t have been possible without the constant support of fellow activists. But I believe this played an important role in my college admissions.\
Furthermore, my research paper publications and the entrepreneurship development program I made must have made my Outlier. (read Malcolm Gladwell’s Outlier)

**Work experience**– At 18, I got the opportunity to serve in ‘the India’s fastest growing Fitness Studio’ MultiFit gyms as an apprentice to the Director Mr Chaitainya Velhal. So much so I progressed from the position of an ‘Operations Intern’ to the ‘Sales Manager’ in a brief tenure of 6 months. This endeavour elevated my perspective towards the worlds, which was reflected very clearly in my application.

**Research**– I put in 1000s of hours (if not tens of thousands) into researching everything about the application: universities, scholarship programs, alumni reports, Test prep., departments and the courses offered, history, college policies etc. USA College Applications became my second forte, first being Table Tennis.

**Originality**– In the whole process of applications, as in my life, I made sure I was original and true to my personal beliefs. At no point did I make any decisions with it-would-make-my-CV-better intentions. I never joined any MUNs, participated in international paid conferences or interned at multiple renowned firms just for the sake of college apps. I did not brag about the achievements I earned at the school level. I undertook personal projects such as meditating in Dharamshala, teaching free of cost table tennis to younglings, taking multiple Online courses purely for learning from it. Although it opened me to diverse opportunities, I was able to hold my truest form in the applications.
